DeckOfCards
===========
This Deck of Cards model was constructed following the tutorial cited below (as Source Material).

In terms of revisions, the major components of the model were separated into HTML (structure), CSS (style), and Javascript (function).

Extension:
In the original model, the bet amount was fixed at 1. I have added an input field where the user can choose an integer between 1-100. When dealing, one's score is decremented by the new bet amount and the Addscore function has been modified so that the player earns points as a multiple of their selected bet amount.
